# README

This is a very simple ruby on rails app that shows off what I've learned in my free time after ~10 days. 

The main features of this app are session based user authentication, a simple mysql storage system based per user, and error handling.

My time on this project was spent completing the Codecademy courses for Ruby and Ruby on Rails, setting up and configuring Ubuntu, mySql, mySql Workbench, a git repo, and VS Code on Windows 10, and designing/coding the app.
